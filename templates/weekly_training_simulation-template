					******OFFICE USE ONLY******


How To Use This Weekly Template:


1.	Pull in your daily simulation logs for the week.

2.	Fill in the daily snapshots table.

3.	Analyze trends — look for patterns in CPU, RAM, disk, network, and errors.

4.	Flag alerts for immediate action and watch points.

5.	Summarize action items and provide simple recommendations for your client.

6.	Keep this document as part of your weekly reporting workflow — over time, you’ll see patterns 
	and can provide more valuable insights.

💡 Extra Tip:
You can eventually generate this automatically if you write a small Python script that reads the daily 
simulation logs and outputs a pre-filled weekly Markdown or JSON report — we can tackle that next once 
you’re comfortable with manual filling.
